Known Bugs:

- I couldn't get the randomly generated spawn points to work at all. If a character spawns on top of one of the terrain doodads, they're stuck and cannot move. Just reload the game. (Sorry! :( )
- The animations decide to stop playing after a number of seconds. It happened mid-development, and I didn't have time to really investigate why.
